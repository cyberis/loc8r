loc8r - Wifi Near You
=====================

This is the app that gets built over the course of the book, **Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular and Node** by *Simon Holmes*.

The original code for this project can be found at https://github.com/simonholmes/getting-MEAN.

I will likely follow Simon's lead but may divert at places and make this my own. I will also probably follow his branching structure since that's pretty good git practice but again, I might divert or add to this where, especially once I've completed the book.

I started this project on Monday, April 11th, 2016.
